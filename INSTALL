Installation
------------

To compile the libhilbert library you need to do the following:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local/libhilbert ..
make all
sudo make install

Add library and include path to system PATH variables

If you want to extend the hilbert curve to higher dimensions than
N=10, have a look at tools/hilbertKey.py:

python hilbertKey.py dim

will generate the required Hilbert generating genes up to the 
given dimension. This needs to be then embedded into a header
file (see N10.h for comparison) and properly included in hilbertKey.c.

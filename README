libhilbert library
------------------

This library provides an implementation of the Chenyang, Hong, Nengchao
2008 IEEE N-dimensional Hilber mapping algorithm. The Hilbert generating
genes are statically compiled into the library, thus producing a rather
large executable size. Hilbert generating genes can be generated using
the provided python script.

This library support the forward and backward mapping algorithms from 
R_N -> R_1 and R_1 -> R_N. The library is used straigth forwardly and
for guidance and documentation, see hilbertKey.h.

For suggestions, bugs, improvements or a whish to extend the library
to dynamic Hilbert generating gene creation for dimensions higher than
N=20 please contact the author:
